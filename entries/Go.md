# Go
Go is a fast statically typed, compiled high-level general purpose programming language. It is known for its simplicity and efficiency. It was designed at Google in 2009 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is syntactically similar to C, but also has memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency. It is often referred to as Golang because of its former domain name, golang.org, but its proper name is Go.
